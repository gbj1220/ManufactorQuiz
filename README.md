# ManufactorQuiz

## **Main Goals:**
*Given a specific model of a vehicle, the user must respond with the correct manufacture. They will receive 3 chances per model. If they have guessed wrong 3 times they will be ejected from the game! To start, hard code the vehicle information into 3 questions.*

## **Stretch Goals:**
1. *Instead of only getting kicked out if user answers wrong three times on one question, user will be kicked for getting 3 answers wrong in general. Whether user is wrong three times on one question or once on all three they are ejected.*

2. *Instead of hard coding the vehicle models into the quiz, make an array of objects and have one model randomly chosen for each question.*
